Please do not mail security issues to public lists, nor file a ticket, unless we do not get back to you in a timely manner.
We fully credit reporters of security issues, and respond quickly, but please allow us a reasonable timeframe to coordinate a response.

We remind PowerDNS and dnsdist users that under the terms of the GNU General Public License, PowerDNS and dnsdist come with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY.

Security issues can also be reported on [our HackerOne page](https://hackerone.com/powerdns) and might fetch a bounty.
Do note that only the PowerDNS software (PowerDNS Authoritative Server, the PowerDNS Recursor and dnsdist) is in scope for the HackerOne program, not our websites or other infrastructure.

- Let us know as soon as possible upon discovery of a potential security issue, and we'll make every effort to quickly resolve the issue.
- Provide us a reasonable amount of time to resolve the issue before any disclosure to the public or a third-party.
- We will always credit researchers in our security advisories.
