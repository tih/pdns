End of life statements
======================

We aim to have a release every six months.
The latest and previous release receive correctness, stability and security updates.
The release before that gets critical security updates only.
Older releases are marked end of life and receive no updates at all.
Pre-releases do not receive immediate security updates.

The currently supported release train of the PowerDNS Recursor is 4.4.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.3 will only receive correctness, stability and
security updates and will be receiving critical security updates only
after PowerDNS Recursor 4.5 is released. It wil be end of life after
PowerDNS Recursor 4.6 is released.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.2 will only receive critical security updates. It
wil be end of life after PowerDNS Recursor 4.5 is released.

PowerDNS Recursor 4.1, 4.0, 3.x, and 2.x are End of Life.

Note: Users with a commercial agreement with PowerDNS.COM BV or Open-Xchange
can receive extended support for releases which are End Of Life. If you are
such a user, these EOL statements do not apply to you.
